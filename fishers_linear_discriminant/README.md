# Linear Discriminant Analysis

Linear Discriminant Analysis (also called Fisher's Linear Discriminant) is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique that finds a decision boundary by finding a lower dimensional manifold where the difference in maximimised and variation about the means is minimised. This lower dimensional manifold is found by using an optimisation technique.
